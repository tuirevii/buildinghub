**UI & UX Design | Figma | Semi-Interactive Prototype (Wireframes) of a Web Service**

- **Target group(s):** Residents, housing companies, contractors, architects, etc., but we focused on residents
- **Team:** 4 members
- **Client:** INPERSO project (Spain)
- **Course:** "HTI.450 User Experience: Design and Evaluation", Tampere University

## Motivation

- The project was assigned to us on the Tampere University's course.
- Several stakeholders are typically involved in renovation projects, and effective communication among these stakeholders plays a key role in completing the project on schedule and with the required quality. 
- Currently, there are some communication channels available, but they cannot, for example, adequately and promptly inform all necessary stakeholders before, during, and after the project. 
- The demand for such a tool is likely to grow in the coming years due to the EU’s energy efficiency goals for the built environment. 


## Goals and Scope

- To design and develop the digital BuildingHub solution 
- To enhance the user experience by providing easy access to building information and involving users in renovation decisions 
- To explore user-centric innovation by gathering insights to make building renovations more community-driven


## My Role

- Together with team members searched for articles, attended weekly meetings, wrote the report, planned the user study, participated in the interviews (user study & evaluation), and analysed data
- Recruited 8 participants (3 for the user study and 5 for the evaluation)
- Created the user persona with another team member
- Created the experience journey map
- Created the prototype together with two other team members
- Prepared the questionnaire and script for the user study and evaluation
- Iterated the prototype after evaluation


## Project Overview

![Overview of the project including, for example, desk research, user study, defining and iteration, wireframing/prototyping, and protototype evaluation and iteration.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5aa11a97-a6cf-44a8-984d-ee81e96c8599)


## Methods Used

## Desk Research

- Will be added here later

## User Study

- Semi-structured interviews
- Observation
- Data analysis with affinity diagram

### Goals

- Understand target users, their needs, references, and feelings evoked during each phase of the renovation project.
- Identify negative experiences and come up with ideas to make the experiences positive or at least improve them

### Interviewed Participants
- N=4
- All Finnish males
- Aged 35-40
- From diverse fields, including one architect
- Relatively tech-savvy

### Main Findings

- **Concerns** arise at every phase due to poor **trust** and **communication**.
- Finding **reliable contractors** and comparing offers is difficult, recommendations may be fake, and subcontractors unmotivated.
- Residents are not **well-informed** about project progress or issues.
- Desire for trust in quality work, timely completion, and no extra costs.
- Residents feel **relief** at the end, whether from satisfaction or simply the project being over.


## Experience Journey Map

I created this.

## User Persona

I created this with Canva together with another team member.

## User Scenario

- Tero just got his first-ever owned apartment through the housing cooperative, and he is embarking on an extensive bathroom renovation. He **signs up** on the BuildingHub platform with his laptop to start a new project.
- On the web service, he **invites** the superintendent of the housing cooperative to join the project. He searches for** **reliable construction companies based on for example location, offering and ratings. 
- He **contacts** a few construction professionals for proposal/offer submission and can review and make a selection. He is also able to **see/know** sub-contractors working for the main construction company. 
- Through the platform, he can see for example the contract, renovation plan, electricity and piping plans as well as the project schedule provided by the professionals, and he is also able to supply needed information. 
- As the renovation project commences, he is **informed** of the activities ongoing on the site, hurdles, etc. through email notifications from the BuildingHub portal. When he notices some poor work quality on the project site, he can then through the portal, **inform all the parties** involved in the project and add images for evidence, clarification, and documentation. 
- Once the project is verified to be complete by all parties, a **feedback** form is sent to everyone to provide input about how the project went.

  
## Experience Goals

Based on desk research, literature reviews, and empathy towards target group, we identified five tentative UX goals (completion, relief, relatedness, security, and self-esteem). After analysing the user study results, these goals were refined and brought down to following four:

1. Trust
2. Feeling of being informed
3. Relief
4. Security (safety)

These experience goals reflected only the experiences of the residents during the three phases of the renovation project and addressed their needs and pain points.


## Wireframes/Prototype

The concept for the prototype was a **digital platform (web service)** that would be responsive and accessible through the internet from a web browser especially on a laptop, reducing the need for any specific system or device compatibility. The features of the prototype were ideated and designed based on the insights gathered from the user study. The user study had revealed that the users wouldn't like to use this kind of system with their mobile phones, but instead would use their computers. Therefore and due to the scope of the course, we focused on designing the prototype for the desktop.

## Prototype Evaluation

### Participants
- N=5 
- 4 females & 1 male
- Aged 35-51
- Mainly not that tech-savvy

### Main Findings

- It’s really hard to mention even the main findings, as this was such a large project. However, everything is mentioned in our project’s final report.

## Prototype Iteration

- Focus on fulfilling one of the UX goals, trust. 
- Changes to the company card (information about the working area, prices, and starting schedule, and more comprehensive reviews).
- Adding a helps section and guiding to that from an empty dashboard.
- Renaming “Home” to “Project dashboard” and setting the navigation to fixed. 
- Some other minor changes.
